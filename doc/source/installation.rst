Installation
************


Using a Terminal
================

To install GridPath, you will need to use a command-line interface. Once
installed, you will be able to interact with the platform through the user
interface.

On Windows, you can use cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell, or another command-line
interface (we test using cmd.exe, so recommend using that). You can search
for cmd.exe from the Start menu. On Mac, you can use the Terminal
application. Search for it with Spotlight by clicking the magnifying glass
icon in the upper-right corner of the menu bar, or by pressing
Command-Space bar.


GridPath Directory
==================

You first need to create a directory where to download GridPath's source
code. We will refer to this directory as :code:`PATH/TO/GRIDPATH`.

Source Code
===========
GridPath's source code is stored in a GitHub repository. You will need
Git to download the source code.

Installing Git
--------------
Git installation instructions are `here <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__

On Windows, use the Git installer available `here <https://git-scm
.com/download/win>`__.

On MacOS, type :code:`git --version` on the command line; if you don't have
Git installed already, you will be prompted to install it.

On RPM-based Linux distributions (e.g Fedora), use :code:`sudo dnf install
git-all`; on Debian-based Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), use :code:`sudo
apt install git-all`.

Cloning the GridPath Repository
-------------------------------

Once you have Git installed, clone the repository with::

    git clone https://github.com/anamileva/gridpath.git PATH/TO/GRIDPATH

(You could also navigate to :code:`PATH/TO/GRIDPATH` with
:code:`cd PATH/TO/GRIDPATH` and run
:code:`git clone https://github.com/anamileva/gridpath.git .` to clone into
the current directory.)

For more info on cloning repositories, see `the instructions on GitHub
<https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository>`__.

We will eventually distribute GridPath through pypi and conda, so cloning the
repository will not be required except for users who want to edit the source
code.


Requirements
============

Python
------

Running GridPath requires a Python 3 installation and several Python
packages. You can get the official CPython distribution `here
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__, the Anaconda Python distribution
`here <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`__, or `another Python
distribution <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions>`_. GridPath
is written and tested in Python 3.8 and we do not recommend using other Python
versions.


.. _python-virtual-env-section-ref:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python Virtual Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We highly recommend that you set up a Python virtual
environment for GridPath to ensure that the appropriate packages are
installed and avoid interfering with the requirements of other Python
programs you may be using. Below are instructions for how to set up a
virtual environment using Python's *venv* module or with Anaconda. Make sure
to keep track of where your virtual environment directory is located, as you
will need to locate it if you are using the GridPath user interface. We will
refer to the GridPath Python environment directory as
:code:`PATH/TO/PYTHON/ENV`.

venv
****
The `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ package is part of
the Python 3 standard library and is a lightweight method for managing
virtual environments. Once you have installed Python 3, you can create the
virtual environment for GridPath by running::

    python3 -m venv PATH/TO/PYTHON/ENV

This will create the virtual environment in the :code:`PATH/TO/PYTHON/ENV`
directory.

On Windows, you can activate the virtual environment by running appropriate
activation script from inside the Scripts directory of the virtual
environment directory.

From cmd.exe::

    C:\> PATH\TO\PYTHON\ENV\Scripts\activate.bat

On Linux-based systems including MacOS, use::

    source PATH/TO/PYTHON/ENV/bin/activate

Anaconda
********
Another way to set up a virtual environment is via the Anaconda Python
distribution. `You can obtain Anaconda here <https://www.anaconda
.com/distribution/>`_. Create the GridPath environment with::

    conda env create --name gridpath

By default, environments are installed into the `envs` directory in your
conda directory. To activate the environment before running GridPath, enter
the following::

    source activate gridpath


^^^^^^^^
Packages
^^^^^^^^

GridPath uses the following Python packages (not exhaustive):

* `sqlite3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`_ for database
  interface (comes with Python's standard library)
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ for storing data and array
  manipulations
* `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ for calculations
* `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ for network calculations
* `bokeh <https://bokeh.org/>`_ for interactive plotting
* `pyomo <http://www.pyomo.org/>`_ for creating optimization problems

Most users should install GridPath and its graphical user interface by navigating to
the GridPath directory :code:`PATH/TO/GRIDPATH` with :code:`cd PATH/TO/GRIDPATH` and
running::

    pip install .[ui]

Use the editable `-e` flag if you would like to edit the GridPath source code::

    pip install -e .[ui]

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the GUI, you can install only the minimum set of
required packages with::

    pip install .


Developer extras
****************

You should also install additional packages if you plan to build the documentation
from source, use the Black code formatter, or check test coverage.

To install all packages, run::

    pip install -e .[all]

GridPath's developer extras can be installed individually as follows.

For editing or building documentation from source, run::

    pip install -e .[doc]

For using the Black code formatter, run::

   pip install -e .[black]

For getting code test coverage information run::

    pip install -e .[coverage]

If you would like to edit the user-interface code, you will need Node.js in
addition to Python and will be required to install various node packages.
See the User Interface section for more info.


Database
--------
While not strictly required -- you can generate TAB-delimited scenario input
files any way you like -- GridPath includes support for input and output
data management via an SQLite database. We recommend that you store data in
the database and use GridPath's built-in tools for loading input data into the
database, creating scenarios and generating scenario input files, and
importing scenario results into the database. Using the GridPath user
interface requires that data be stored in a database.

We recommend `SQLite Studio <https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt>`_ as an SQLite
database GUI.

We have implemented various tools to help you build your database. See the
:ref:`database-section-ref` section of the documentation for more information.

Solver
------
You will need a solver to get optimization results. GridPath assumes you
will be using `Cbc (Coin-or branch and cut) <https://projects.coin-or
.org/Cbc>`_ by default, but you can specify a different solver as long as it
is `supported by Pyomo <https://pyomo.readthedocs
.io/en/latest/solving_pyomo_models.html#supported-solvers>`_,
e.g. GLPK, CPLEX, Gurobi, etc.

You can find the latest instructions for installing Cbc `here
<https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc#download>`__. On Windows, you can also
download the Cbc executable from the `AMPL website <https://ampl
.com/products/solvers/open-source/#cbc>`_. GridPath allows you to specify
the location of the solver executable; to get it to be recognized,
automatically, you can also add it to your PATH system variables (see
instructions for Windows `here <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path
.xml>`__).


Testing Your Installation
=========================

To test the GridPath codebase, use the unittest module as follows from the
:code:`PATH/TO/GRIDPATH` directory::

    python -m unittest discover tests

This command will use the python `unittest  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/
unittest.html>`_ module to test all functions in the :code:`./tests` folder.
Testing includes both simple unittests as well as integration tests that run
small example problems (for which you will need a solver).

Note: the -m switch allows modules to be located using the Python module name
space for execution as scripts, so it can be located just as if its filename was
provided in the command line.
